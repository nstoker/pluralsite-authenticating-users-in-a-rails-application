# Authenticating Users in a Rails Application

Based on the [Authenticating Users in a Rails Application By Anthony Alampi tutorial](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/rails-application-authenticating-users/table-of-contents) followed at the end of a free week on Pluralsight.

Some additions made.

## TODO

The tests aren't running (I would have thought best practice would be to demonstrate testing at the same time as demonstrating the code).
